Prompt 1:
Explain the task of image denoising using a denoising autoencoder and describe its real-world applications.

Prompt 2:
Provide Python code to load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset, including normalization and train-validation-test split.

Prompt 3:
Write code to add Gaussian noise and salt-and-pepper noise to CIFAR-10 images and visualize clean versus noisy samples.

Prompt 4:
Design and implement a convolutional denoising autoencoder using PyTorch. Explain the encoder, bottleneck, and decoder structure.

Prompt 5:
Show how to train the denoising autoencoder using MSE loss and Adam optimizer. Include training and validation loss curves.

Prompt 6:
Provide code to evaluate the trained model using MSE, PSNR, and SSIM metrics.

Prompt 7:
Generate visualizations showing original, noisy, and reconstructed images in a grid format.

Prompt 8:
Run experiments using different noise levels and bottleneck sizes. Compare the performance using tables and plots.

Prompt 9:
Analyze the experimental results and explain how noise level and latent dimension affect reconstruction quality.

Prompt 10:
Write a discussion section describing model strengths, weaknesses, limitations, and possible improvements.

Prompt 11:
Prepare a complete research-style report in LNCS LaTeX format including abstract, methodology, results, and conclusion.

Prompt 12:
Explain common training and visualization errors in PyTorch and provide solutions.

Prompt 13:
Suggest methods to improve denoising performance such as deeper networks, skip connections, and perceptual loss.

Prompt 14:
Summarize the overall findings of the denoising autoencoder project for final submission.
